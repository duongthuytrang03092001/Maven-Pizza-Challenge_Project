#Data Cleaning and Transformation

1. Use Power Query Editor in Power BI to clean and transform the data as needed
   - Handle missing values
   - Delete duplicates rows
   - Data type conversions
   - And any necessary data preprocessing
2. Create a Tidy Date: To connect with Order Table by DAX for Table 
*DAX Syntax: 

"Tidy Date = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(FIRSTDATE(orders[date]),LASTDATE(orders[date])),
"Year", year([Date]),
"Quater",  FORMAT([Date],"\QQ"),
"Month_num", MONTH([Date]),
"Month_name", FORMAT([Date], "mmmm"),
"Week_Num", WEEKNUM([Date]),
"Day_Month_Num", DAY([Date]),
"Day_Week_Name", FORMAT([Date],"dddd"),
"Week_Month", "W" & (WEEKNUM([Date]) - WEEKNUM(DATE(YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1)) + 1)
)" 

3. Create a entity relationship diagram (ERD)


4. To answer the question posed to this data and to address the purpose of the project
Use DAX of Power BI function to generate the results
+ Revenue = CALCULATE(SUMX(order_details,order_details[quantity]*RELATED(pizzas[price])))
+ Total sold = CALCULATE(SUM(order_details[quantity]))
+ Avg of Order = AVERAGEX(order_details,order_details[quantity]*RELATED(pizzas[price]))
+ Avg of Product = AVERAGEX(ALL(pizza_types),SUMX(RELATEDTABLE(order_details),order_details[quantity]*RELATED(pizzas[price])))
+ Worst-selling = TOPN(5,
                ADDCOLUMNS(VALUES(pizza_types[name]),
                     "Sold ", CALCULATE(COUNT(order_details[quantity]))),
                     [Sold ] ,ASC)
+ Best selling = TOPN(5,
                ADDCOLUMNS(VALUES(pizza_types[name]),
                     "Sold ", CALCULATE(COUNT(order_details[quantity]))),
                     [Sold ] ,DESC)

+ Friday is the best business day with total sales of 8.2k in the time frame 12:00 - 13:00 pm and 17:00-18:00.
