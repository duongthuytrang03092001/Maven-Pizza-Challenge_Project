I. Work with data
1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
Use Power Query Editor in Power BI to clean and transform the data as needed
   - Handle missing values
   - Delete duplicates rows
   - Data type conversions
   - And any necessary data preprocessing

2. Create a entity relationship diagram (ERD)
Build Data Model in Power BI

3. Create a Tidy Date: To connect with Order Table by DAX for Table 
*DAX Syntax: 

"Tidy Date = 
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(FIRSTDATE(orders[date]),LASTDATE(orders[date])),
"Year", year([Date]),
"Quater",  FORMAT([Date],"\QQ"),
"Month_num", MONTH([Date]),
"Month_name", FORMAT([Date], "mmmm"),
"Week_Num", WEEKNUM([Date]),
"Day_Month_Num", DAY([Date]),
"Day_Week_Name", FORMAT([Date],"dddd"),
"Week_Month", "W" & (WEEKNUM([Date]) - WEEKNUM(DATE(YEAR([Date]), MONTH([Date]), 1)) + 1)
)" 

4. To answer the question posed to this data and to address the purpose of the project
Use DAX of Power BI function to generate the results
- Dax for Measure
+ Revenue = CALCULATE(SUMX(order_details,order_details[quantity]*RELATED(pizzas[price])))
+ Total sold = CALCULATE(SUM(order_details[quantity]))
+ Avg of Order = AVERAGEX(order_details,order_details[quantity]*RELATED(pizzas[price]))
+ Avg of Product = AVERAGEX(ALL(pizza_types),SUMX(RELATEDTABLE(order_details),order_details[quantity]*RELATED(pizzas[price])))

-Dax for Table
+ Worst-selling = TOPN(5,
                ADDCOLUMNS(VALUES(pizza_types[name]),
                     "Sold ", CALCULATE(COUNT(order_details[quantity]))),
                     [Sold ] ,ASC)
+ Best selling = TOPN(5,
                ADDCOLUMNS(VALUES(pizza_types[name]),
                     "Sold ", CALCULATE(COUNT(order_details[quantity]))),
                     [Sold ] ,DESC)

II. Create Dashboard by Power BI visualization

+ This report is for Product manager, Store Manager
+ Metrics: Revenue, Quantity, Price, ...
+ Dimension: Products Name, Products Category, Time by Month, Week Name, Hours,...
+ Visual: Card, Table with heat map, Bar chart, Column chart, Circle chart,...
